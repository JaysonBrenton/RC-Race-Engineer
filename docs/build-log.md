# Build Log

This log tracks release builds and documentation of generated artifacts. Keep it up to date so we can trace exactly what shipped and under which conditions.

## Update workflow
- **Who**: The engineer (human or agent) responsible for the build run updates this file before publishing artifacts.
- **When**: Add a new entry immediately after a successful release build or when regenerating artifacts that ship to users.
- **How**: Append a row to the table below with the UTC date, commit SHA, build environment summary, identifiers/URLs for any generated artifacts, and concise release notes.
