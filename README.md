# The RC Racing Engineer

## Build tracking
Release and artifact builds are logged in [docs/build-log.md](docs/build-log.md). Update the log immediately after each successful release build so future maintainers can trace what was shipped and when.

Fresh start. This repo contains the web app and related tooling for The RC Racing Engineer project.
