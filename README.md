# RC Race Engineer

Fresh start. This repo contains the web app and related tooling for the RC Race Engineer project.

## Build tracking
Release and artifact builds are logged in [docs/build-log.md](docs/build-log.md). Update the log immediately after each successful release build so future maintainers can trace what was shipped and when.
