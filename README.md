# RC-Race-Engineer

> WIP: Short one‑liner about the project (e.g., telemetry + strategy helper for RC racing). Update once scope is set.

## Status
Pre‑alpha — exploring scope and requirements. PRs welcome.

## Goals
- Clean, maintainable code and docs
- Reproducible local setup
- Safe handling of secrets (never commit `.env`)


## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JaysonBrenton/RC-Race-Engineer.git
cd RC-Race-Engineer
